You can then log out and log back in later to check on the process. Your process will still be running, even if your ssh session is closed.\n\nOn the remote server\ntmux new -s myprocess\nThen run your process. When you are done, detach from the session by pressing Ctrl+b and then d.\n\n\nOn the remote server later\ntmux ls\nThis will list all the sessions. You can then reattach to the session you want by typing:\ntmux attach -t myprocess\n\n\nPanes\nYou can split your terminal into panes. This is useful if you want to run multiple processes in the same terminal. You can split the terminal vertically by pressing Ctrl+b and then \" or horizontally by pressing Ctrl+b and then %.\nTo move panes around, you can use Ctrl+b and then o to cycle through the panes.\n\n\n\n\nGuo, Jeff, and Philippe Schwaller. 2024. “It Takes Two to Tango: Directly Optimizing for Constrained Synthesizability in Generative Molecular Design.” arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2410.11527.\n\n\nLandrum, Gregory A., Jessica Braun, Paul Katzberger, Marc T.

That means, in general, if you have something for which there is a built-in pandas (or numpy) function, you should use that instead of apply, because those functions will be optimized and typically vectorized.\nThe pandarallel package allows you to parallelize apply on a pandas DataFrame or Series object. It does this by using multiprocessing. However, since it uses multiple processes, it will use more memory than a simple apply.\nIf your data just barley fits in memory, you should not use pandarallel.

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\nThe authors propose to fuse multiple features. In addition, they also use a special loss function and a mixture of experts (MoE) model used to transform human-designed features.\n\n\n\nOverview of the model architecture. Figure taken from Chem et al. (Chen et al. 2024)\n\n\n\nGraph encoder and SMILES encoder\nThe authors pretrain the graph and SMILES encoders using a contrastive loss. The graph encoder is a GNN, the SMILES encoder is a transformer.\n\nGraph convolutional neural network\nTheir graph encoder is basically a message graph convolutional neural network. The authors use the DGL library to implement this.\nThe forward pass looks like this:\nfor _ in range(self.num_step_message_passing):\n    node_feats = self.activation(self.gnn_layer(g, node_feats, edge_feats)).unsqueeze(0)\n    node_feats, hidden_feats = self.gru(node_feats, hidden_feats)\n    node_feats = node_feats.squeeze(0)\nWhere the GNN layer performs a simple operation such as\n\\[\n\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}=\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}^{\\top} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i) \\cup\\{i\\}} \\frac{e_{j, i}}{\\sqrt{\\hat{d}_j \\hat{d}_i}} \\mathbf{x}_j\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{d}_i\\) is the degree of node \\(i\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}\\) is a learnable weight matrix. \\(\\mathcal{N}(i)\\) is the set of neighbors of node \\(i\\). \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) is the node embedding of node \\(i\\), \\(e_{j, i}\\) is the edge feature between node \\(i\\) and \\(j\\).\nThe node embeddings are then aggregated using Set2Set pooling (Vinyals, Bengio, and Kudlur 2016).\n\n\nSMILES encoder\nFor encoding SMILES, the use a transformer model. In their code, they seem to pass through only one transformer layer.\nThe forward pass looks like this:\nx = self.token_embedding(text)\nx = x + self.positional_embedding\nx = x.permute(1, 0, 2)  # NLD -&gt; LND\nx = self.transformer(x)\nx = x.permute(1, 0, 2)  # LND -&gt; NLD\nx = self.ln_final(x)\nx = self.pooler(x[:,0,:])\nThey take the first token of the sequence and pass it through a linear layer to get the final representation.\n\n\nContrastive training\nThe authors use a contrastive loss to train the encoders.\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_c=-\\frac{1}{2} \\log \\frac{e^{\\left\\langle f_G^j, f_S^j\\right\\rangle / \\tau}}{\\sum_{k=1}^N e^{\\left\\langle f_G^j, f_S^k\\right\\rangle / \\tau}}-\\frac{1}{2} \\log \\frac{e^{\\left\\langle f_G^j, f_S^j\\right\\rangle / \\tau}}{\\sum_{k=1}^N e^{\\left\\langle f_G^k, f_S^j\\right\\rangle / \\tau}},\n\\]\nIn contrastive training, we try to maximize the similarity between positive pairs and minimize the similarity between negative pairs. In the equation above, \\(f_G^j\\) and \\(f_S^j\\) are the representations of the graph and SMILES of the same reaction, respectively. \\(\\tau\\) is a temperature parameter.\nSuch contrastive training allows to pretrain the encoders on a large dataset without labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nContrastive learning is one of the most popular methods in self-supervised learning. A good overview can be found in Lilian Weng’s amazing blog.\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman-features encoder\nThe authors also encode additional features with feedforward networks in a mixture of experts (MoE) model. The key idea behind MoE is that we replace “conventional layers” with “MoE layers” which are copies of the same layer. A gating network decides, based on the input, which layer to use. This is powerful if we sparsely select the experts-then only a subset of all weights are used in a given forward pass.\n\\[\n\\operatorname{MoE}\\left(x_H\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^t \\mathcal{G}\\left(x_H\\right)_i \\cdot E_i\\left(x_H\\right)\n\\]\nThis is a mixture of experts model. The authors use a gating network \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) to decide which expert to use. The experts \\(E_i\\) are simple feedforward networks. The gating network might be a simple softmax layer:\n\\[\nG_\\sigma(x)=\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(x \\cdot W_g\\right)\n\\]\nin practice, one can improve that by adding sparsity (e.g. selecting top-k).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMoE (Shazeer et al. 2017) has become popular recently as a way to scale LLMs. You might have across model names like Mixtral-8x7B (Jiang et al. 2024), which indicates that the model is a mixture of 8 experts, each of which is a 7B parameter model. The total number of parameters is 47B parameters, but the inference cost is similar to the one of a 14B parameter model. (Note however, that memory consumption is still high as all experts need to be loaded into memory.)\nThis blog by Cameron Wolfe gives a good overview. You might also find Yannic Kilcher’s video about Mixtral of Experts useful.\n\n\n\n\nFusion\nThe fusion of the different features is done by concatenating them\nThe complete forward pass looks like this:\nr_graph_feats = torch.sum(torch.stack([self.clme.mpnn(mol) for mol in rmols]), 0)\np_graph_feats = self.clme.mpnn(pmols)\nfeats, a_loss = self.mlp(input_feats)\nseq_feats = self.clme.transformer(smiles)\nconcat_feats = torch.cat([r_graph_feats, p_graph_feats, feats, seq_feats], 1)\nout = self.predict(concat_feats)\nwhere the mpnn method is the graph encoder, the transformer method is the SMILES encoder, and the mlp method is the human-features encoder.\n\n\nUncertainty (quantification)\nThe authors define the prediction as\n\\[\n\\hat{y}=\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x})+\\epsilon * \\sigma(\\boldsymbol{x})\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x})\\) is the prediction, \\(\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{x})\\) is the uncertainty, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a random variable sampled from a normal distribution.\nThe model is trained with a loss function that includes the uncertainty:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_u=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_i\\right)^2}\\left\\|y_i-\\mu\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_i\\right)\\right\\|^2+\\log \\sigma\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_i\\right)^2\\right]\n\\]\nThe \\(\\sigma\\) term is capturing observation noise (aleatoric uncertainty).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis loss comes from the idea of variational inference.\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda})=-\\mathbb{E}_{q(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} ; \\boldsymbol{\\lambda})}[\\log p(\\mathbf{y} \\mid \\mathbf{x}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})]+\\mathrm{KL}(q(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} ; \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}) \\| p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}))\n\\]\nIn this equation, the first term is the negative log-likelihood, and the second term is the KL divergence between the approximate posterior \\(q(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} ; \\boldsymbol{\\lambda})\\) and the prior \\(p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\). The KL divergence is a measure of how much the approximate posterior diverges from the prior. The idea is to minimize the negative log-likelihood while keeping the approximate posterior close to the prior. This is a way to quantify the uncertainty in the model.\nThe idea comes from Bayesian inference, where we want to estimate the posterior distribution over the parameters of the model. In practice, this is intractable, so we use variational inference to approximate the posterior with a simpler distribution. The posterior (which quantifies uncertainty) is typically computationally expensive to compute, so we use variational inference to approximate it with a simpler distribution, this is called variational inference. Since during training, we do some sampling, we need to perform a reparametrization trick (Kingma, Salimans, and Welling 2015) to make the gradients flow through the sampling operation.",

    "text": "Prior work\n\nOld ages\nSeveral works from the Ceder group showed the complete tedious process. First, Huo et al. (Huo et al. 2019) use LDA + RF to classify text. To train the RF model they had to manually label 6000 materials paragraphs as they contain synthesis information or not.\nIn a following work, Kononova et al. (Kononova et al. 2019) trained a Word2Vec model, to then feed the embeddings to a BiLSTM-CRF. To train this NN they manually annotated more than 800 paragraphs word-by-word with tags about solid-state synthesis role (material, target, precursor or other). Furthermore, to classify the synthesis operations (NOT OPERATION, MIXING, HEATING, etc) they trained another NN with more annotated data. To this step they also had to LEMMATIZED the sentences and obtain each token’s POS. Amazing hard work!\nSimilar works by Kim et al. (Kim et al. 2017, 2020; Mysore et al. 2019) in which they applied similar techniques such as word embeddings from language models, then fed to a named entity recognition model.\n\n\n\nFigure taken from Mysore et al. paper (Mysore et al. 2019) illustrating how they labeled the data for the NER task.\n\n\n\n\nChemDataExtractor 1.0 and 2.0\nCole et al. (Swain and Cole 2016; Mavračić et al. 2021) developed ChemDataExtractor which is build from the combination of traditional ML techniques for each NLP task such as lemmatazion, tokenization, POS tagging, it even include Table Parsing. All of these models trained in chemical text, which made this tool a really good option for extracting chemical data from text.\n\n\nTrewartha et al. (2022)\nTrewartha el al. (Trewartha et al. 2022) compared the performance of a simpler model such as a BiLSTM RNN with three more complex transformer models, BERT, SciBERT and MatBERT for the NER task. For that, they used data from three different NER datasets, each one related with different materials synthesis.\nThe results, showed that the more specialized BERT models were able to better recognize the different entities. However, it is important to remark that the BERT models were fine-tuned for the task.\n\n\n\nFigure taken from Trewartha et al. (Trewartha et al. 2022) summarizing the results that they obtained with each model.",

This can be a tedious work. However, to overcome this limitation, they proposed to include human-in-the-loop annotation.\n\nHuman-in-the-loop\nTo overcome the limitation of having to manually annotate all the data needed for the fine-tuning process, they sucesfully implemented human-in-the-loop annotation. For that, they fine-tune the model with a small amount of manually labelled data. Then the model is asked to extract data from the other text passages. The returned data by the model is corrected by an human annotator and is feed into the model to further fine-tune it.\n\n\n\nFigure showing the process used to implement human-in-the-loop annotation.\n\n\nBy using this technique, they greatly reduce the amount of time needed to annotate the last pieces of text compared with the first ones.\n\n\n\nFigure showing the time reduction across the process of annotation using the human-in-the-loop technique.\n\n\nBy using this annotation method they greatly improve the annotation time solving one of the main drawbacks of fine-tuning an LLM. This great limitation can be seen in another works such as the one by Guo el al. (Jiang Guo et al. 2021) in which they employed 13 graduate and postdoc students to annotate about chemical reactions. After that, they have to even check all the annotation. They estimate that this process took them almost 300 hours.",

    "text": "Overview of MolCLR framework\n\nThe SMILES are converted into graphs in a batch. The graphs consist of nodes and edges. Nodes represent atoms, and edges represent the chemical bonds of a molecule.\nThe authors studied three types of augmentations: atom masking, bond deletion, and sub-graph removal. These augmentations introduce variance to the model, allowing it to learn different substructures/topologies of the same molecule and generalize well to unseen molecules.\nThe GNNs operate based on a message-passing framework. At each node, the local neighborhood information is aggregated and updated iteratively, resulting in node embeddings of the molecule.\nThese embeddings are fed into a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with hidden units to obtain a latent representation of the molecule. The MLP serves as a projection head, mapping the high-dimensional representations from the encoder (GNN) to a lower-dimensional latent space. This projection helps in learning more compact and discriminative representations for the contrastive loss.\nThe key difference between supervised GNNs and self-supervised contrastive GNNs is the training objective. In a supervised setup, where we have access to ground truth labels, we can train the network to optimize standard loss functions such as Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) for classification or Mean Absolute Error/Mean Squared Error (MAE/MSE) for regression. In self-supervised contrastive learning, we aim to learn a latent space where positive pairs are closer and negative pairs are further apart.\nThe goal is to score the agreement between positive pairs higher than that of negative pairs. For a given graph, its positive pair is constructed using data augmentations, while all other graphs in the batch constitute negative pairs.\n\n\n\n\nOverview figure for the MolCLR framework\n\n\nFor more information about GNNs and their applications, check out this review paper [zhou2020graph].",

It is observed that these selected molecules share the same functional groups, including alkyl halides (chlorine), tertiary amines, ketones and aromatics. A thiophene structure can also be found in all the molecules.\nMore examples of query molecules can be found in supplementary information of this paper.\n\n\n\nFigure shows Comparison of MolCLR-learned representations and conventional FPs using the query molecule (PubChem ID 42953211)",

    "text": "Approach\n\nPaCh Format Overview\n\nHeader Byte (8 bit):\n\nDifferentiates format version and data type (molecular or reaction data).\nMolecule header byte: 2 (0x02).\nReaction header byte: 1 (0x01).\nThe remaining 253 values are reserved for future extensions.\nHard declaration of format version in the header to avoid compatibility issues seen in SMILES or MDL formats.\nChanges to specifications for 0x01 and 0x02 require a different header byte to maintain compatibility and parsing efficiency.\n\n\n\n\nMolecule Encoding\n\nHeader Byte: Starts with a byte equal to 2 (0x02).\n12-bit Atom Count: Encodes the number of atoms (max 4095 atoms).\n12-bit Chiral Cis–Trans Bond Count: Encodes the number of chiral cis-trans bonds.\n4-byte Header Block: Consists of the above-mentioned data.\nAtom Blocks: Each atom block is 9 bytes, repeated for each atom.\nAtom Connectivity Coding: Bidirectional coding of atom connectivity, preserving neighbour order essential for stereochemistry coding.\n\nFlattened adjacency matrix without zero connections and atom indices, coded bidirectionally for space efficiency.\n\nBond Orders: Stored without duplicates, representing the upper triangle of the adjacency matrix without zero connections.\n\nSingle bond: 0b000, double bond: 0b001, triple bond: 0b010, aromatic bond: 0b011, coordinate bond: 0b111.\n\nCis–Trans Bonds: Optional repeated 4-byte blocks for cis-trans bonds.\n\nCodes 12-bit numbers of cumulene terminal atoms and bytes with states 0x00 and 0x01 for trans- and cis-forms respectively.\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\nHeader Byte Values: 2 for molecules, 1 for reactions.\nFuture-Proofing: 253 values reserved for extensions.\nCompatibility: Hard declaration of version to avoid issues.\nEfficiency: Simplified parsing and implementation due to structured coding.\nConnectivity Block: Bidirectional, ensuring consistency in neighbour order.\nBond Orders: Stored efficiently without duplicates, utilizing up to 7 bits for alignment to full byte.\nCis–Trans Block: Codes cumulene terminal atoms and cis/trans states for bonds.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Encoded molecule example from the paper by Nugmanov et al.:\n\n\n\nFigure 1 Overview:\n\n(a) Block overview: General structure of the molecule PaCh.\n(b) Atom (#2) block structure: Detailed structure of a specific atom block.\n(c) Adjacency matrix: Bond orders with connected atom indices and flattened connectivity.\n(d) Flattened bond orders for acetic acid: Uses 2 bytes with padding.\n(e) Ccis/Ttrans block: Bytes representation with white-gray row indicating the bytes.\n\nAtom Block Structure (Figure 1b):\n\n12-bit Atom ID: Unique label (1–4095) used in the connectivity block. Important for tasks like reaction analytics, database management, and property prediction.\n4-bit Atom Neighbor Count: Ranges from 0 (e.g., halides) to 15 (hypervalent complexes like ferrocenes).\n2-bit Tetrahedron Stereo Sign: Encodes one of four possible states: not chiral, unknown label, chirality sign.\n2-bit Allene Stereo Sign: Same notation as for tetrahedrons.\n5-bit Isotope Information: Difference from the standard isotope number +16 to avoid negative values. Special case for unspecified isotope. Covers a range from -15 to +15 relative to the standard.\n7-bit Atomic Number: Maximum value of 127, with the current last element being Og (118).\n4 Bytes for Coordinates: x,y coordinates of the atom in float16 format, sufficient for small molecules and saves space.\n3-bit Implicit Hydrogen Count: Ranges from 0 to 6, with a special case for unknown hydrogen count. Important for accurate analysis in cheminformatics. Proper representation requires Kekule form for structures with aromatic bonds.\n4-bit Atomic Charge: Ranges from -4 to 4, shifted by 4 to avoid negative numbers (e.g., 4 for neutral).\n1-bit Radical State: Binary coding for radical state (0b0 for no radical, 0b1 for radical). Suitable for most organic molecules with a single unpaired electron. Limitation in coding carbenes: 0 for singlet, 1 for triplet.\n\n\n\n\nReaction Encoding\n\nHeader Byte: Reaction PaCh begins with a header byte of 1 (0x01).\nByte Counts: Followed by 3 bytes representing the counts of reactants, reagents, and products.\nLimitation:Maximum of 255 molecules per category, totalling 765 molecules.\nContinuous Addition: Molecules are added continuously to the first 4 bytes without separators.\nMDL RXN Format: Similar to PaCh but differs in the order of molecules; reagents come last.\nSMILES Order: Uses the order of reactants-reagents-products with a “&gt;” as a separator.\nSize Information: Packed molecules must contain byte size information for proper restoration.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Structure of the reaction PaCh with one reactant and one product from the paper by Nugmanov et al.:\n\n\nNote: PaCh is using Zlib compression for increasing memory effectiveness.\n\n\nStereochemistry Coding\n\nThe stereochemistry coding in PaCh is relative, meaning it depends on neighbours’ connectivity order. This is similar to SMILES notation and helps avoid misinterpretations compared to absolute stereochemistry coding.\n\nTetrahedron: The chirality of tetrahedral centers is determined by calculating the sign of the volume of a pyramid formed by the chiral atom and its three neighbouring atoms. A positive volume indicates clockwise rotation and is coded as 0b11, while a negative volume indicates counterclockwise rotation and is coded as 0b10. Cumulene cis/trans: The cis/trans configuration of cumulenes with an odd number of double bonds is determined by the relative orientation of the first neighbour of each terminal atom. If the first neighbours are on the same side of the double bond chain, it’s cis (0x01), and if they are on opposite sides, it’s trans (0x00). Allenes: The stereochemistry of allenes is determined by the rotation of vectors corresponding to the first neighbours of the terminal atoms across the double bond axis. Clockwise rotation is coded as 0b10, and counterclockwise rotation is coded as 0b11.",

    "text": "Results\n \nSpectrum similarity experiments: Predicted vs. Real spectra for two held-out compounds (Azlocillin and Flamprop-isopropyl) - Accurate Predictions: MassFormer can predict realistic mass spectra for held out compounds. The high cosine similarity values (around 0.6) indicate a close match between the predicted and actual spectra. - Outperforms Existing Models: When compared to other deep learning models (CFM, FP, WLN) on a larger dataset, MassFormer consistently performs better. It shows the highest average cosine similarity across different data splits. - NIST: National Institute of Standards and Technology - MoNA: MassBank of North America - FP: Fingerprint (FP) neural network model - WLN: Weisfeiler–Lehman (WLN) graph neural network model\n \nCollision energy experiments: Benzhydrylpiperazine - MassFormer can not only predict mass spectra accurately but also captures the influence of collision energy on the fragmentation patterns observed in the spectra. - This ability is important for real-world applications where collision energy is a variable factor during data acquisition. - NCEs: Normalized collision energies\n \nExplainability using gradient attributions: Mass spectrum of propranolol - Separation of Nitrogen-Containing Peaks: The gradient attribution maps reveal that nitrogen-containing peaks can be linearly separated from those without nitrogen, demonstrating that the model captures meaningful chemical information related to nitrogen content. - Improved Classification Accuracy: The linear classification accuracy is significantly higher when using nitrogen labeling compared to random labeling, with nearly half of the peaks being perfectly separable based on their gradient attributions, highlighting the effectiveness of the attributions in distinguishing chemical compositions.",

However, Ray and Kirsch (Ray and Kirsch 1957) described an algorithm for substructure searching in a paper published in 1957, which might be considered the first actual cheminformatics paper.\nAlthough cheminformatics as a field has been around for many decades, much of the cheminformatics research has been conducted in industrial laboratories, not academia. Because of this, many applications and methods are not published due to intellectual-property-rights issues (Willett 2011).",

InChI standardises input structures (e.g. to standard tautomers)\nthis way, more control over standardisation and hashing details\n\nQuerying Using Hash Layers\n\ndefault query behaviour of lwreg: standardise query molecule, generate its default registration hash, use it to query the table of registration hashes, return molregno of matching record or none\ncan be specified which layer to use, to e.g. query for all stereoisomers, tautomers, etc.\n\nRetrieving Structures\n\nStructures are retrieved by giving molregnos\nStructures are returned as v3000 MOL blocks\npossible to retrieve standardised structure or “as registered” form of the structure\npossible to retrieve all mol hashes\n\nStoring Conformers\n\nspecial “registerConformers” mode can be set in the system\nconformers of an existing record/structure are stored under its molregno and are each assigned a conf_id related to that molregno (so only fully defined by tuple (molregno, conf_id))\nconformers are also hashed using a simple scheme that arranges the atom coordinates in a defined order, concatenates them, and hashes the result (details in paper)\nthis scheme is independent of the atom ordering but neither translationally nor rotationally invariant (must be standardised at registration if necessary)\n\nStoring Experimental Data\n\nSQL-based database managed by lwreg can be extended with additional tables to store experimental data with relations to the registered molecules\nSee Jupyter Notebook demos in the GitHub repository\ngeneral recommendation would be to store experimental data/results and metadata in separate tables, with UUIDs to identify experiments\n\nAdding Chemical Search: Integration With the RDKit Cartridges\n\nNo similarity or substructure search functions in lwreg\nWould be possible to add externally via the RDKit PostgreSQL cartridge or the chemicalite cartridge for sqlite",

(Jimenez et al. 2024), they introduced another agent benchmark. The tasks that they evaluate are based on GitHub Pull Requests extracted from some popular repositories. They evaluate the agents in solving the issues that are opened in these PRs.

The particularity is that these evaluations are thought to evaluate more than only the agents’ final answers.\n\n\nLAB-Bench\nThis benchmark proposed by Laurent et al. (Laurent et al. 2024) is focused on evaluating agents in the scientific domain, specifically in the medical/biochemistry domain. It is multimodal, including tasks such as analyzing lab images, scientific tables, lab protocols, or retrieving data from biological databases.\n\n\n\nFigure taken from Laurent et al. paper (Laurent et al. 2024) illustrating the results of the different leading LLMs in LAB-Bench.",

They propose to evaluate the agents in three different tasks: CORE-Bench-Easy, CORE-Bench-Medium, and CORE-Bench-Hard. The first one is a simple task, the second one is a medium task, and the last one is a hard task. The evaluation is done so that the agents have to provide the answer and the reasoning behind it.\n\n\n\nTable 21.1: Description of the different tasks according to the difficulty and the actual task for each\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask level\nInformation provided to the agent\nAgent task\n\n\n\n\nCORE-Bench-Easy\nResults are provided\nExtract the results\n\n\nCORE-Bench-Medium\nThe dockerfile is provided\nRun the docker and extract the results\n\n\nCORE-Bench-Hard\nOnly a README is provided\nCreate and run the docker and extract the results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey reproduced some published works to generate the ground truth of the different tasks. To give some numerical room, they sampled by repeating each manual run three times, which was the ground truth for the 95 % prediction interval.\n\n\n\nFigure taken from by Siegel et al. paper (Siegel et al. 2024). In the Figure (a) it is detailed an example for a medium-level task. The figure (b) illustrates how the evaluation is performed.\n\n\nSimilarly to other benchmarks such as MLAgentBench (Huang et al. 2024) or MLE-BENCH (Chan et al. 2024), they provide the agent with access to different files and the agent need to read and run those files to reach the final answer.\nInterestingly, they evaluate two different agents: AutoGPT and CORE-Agent. The first one is a general agent widely used, while the second is an adapted, improved version of the first one.",

However, some important conclusions can be taken from there.\nAs expected and the most obvious is that the performance decreases as the difficulty of the task increases. Also, the bigger model shows better results than the smaller ones, and the adapted agent shows better results than the general one, specially for the smallest or weakest model.\nThey propose a case study in which they study the relation of the agents’ performance with the economical cost of the models. However, this has not much sense since the models powering the agents are not the same, and they have very different costs per tokens expended.\nThe most interesting result these days is that the models perform much better in the text than in the images. They claim that this is the case because the vision tasks are more complex, and the agents are not yet able to perform them. However, in my opinion, more ablations would be needed to clarify this point.\n\nAdditional results\n\nThe results of the Python tasks are better than those of the R tasks.\nAgents struggle to retrieve results from many files.\nBetter safety measures and guardrails are needed to prevent agents from running malicious code when commercially deploying these agents.",

    "text": "Ilya Sutskever at NeurIPS 2024. Reasoning is very prominent on many research agendas. Full video on YouTube\n\n\n\nChain of Thought (CoT)\nChain of thought prompting is a surprisingly simple method that has shown to improve the performance of LLMs on various benchmarks. Effectively, Wei (Wei et al. 2022) showed in their paper (almost 10k citations) that thought demonstrations improve performance.\nKojima (around 3.5k citations) (Kojima et al. 2022) showed that simply adding “Let’s think step by step” into the prompt can yield comparable performance boosts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nVarious CoT variants have been proposed. I think Lilian Weng’s take that many of those things should be blog posts and not papers is true.\nSome useful variants are shown in (Fu et al. 2023). The paper also shows some of the prompt sensitivity (e.g., changing Q: to Question: or using \\n instead of . to separate steps.)\n\n\nSome follow up work as been discussing that one explanation for the improved performance via CoT reasoning is that the effective compute increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCoT can also be thought of as one flavor of test-time compute. This is currently one of the most promising and active streams of research to increase the performance of LLMs. Models like o1 (Qin et al. 2024) heavily lean on utilizing test-time compute (i.e. “thinking” more inference time - ideally, making the amount of thinking proportional to the difficulty of the question).\n\n\n\n\nInternalized CoT\nSince generating extra tokens for reasoning in inference time is expensive, researchers attempted to internalize the reasoning pathway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo converge training, the authors found that it is important to reset optimizer state. Optimizers such as AdamwW keep running averages - and those cause problems when the loss function suddenly changes.\n\n\n\n\nCoT traces are not faithful and might be limiting\n\n\n\nA tweet by one of the godfathers. Reasoning might not need to be verbalized.\n\n\nIt is well known, that CoT traces are not faithful., Turpin showed this by adding biases into the prompt. Those biases led to drops in model performance but were not mentioned by the model. This experiments directly allows to conclude that the verbalized explanations are not faithful as a reason for change in predictions is not verbalized.\nSome anthropomorphize this by linking this to neuroscience results that show that “Language is primarily a tool for communication rather than thought” (Fedorenko, Piantadosi, and Gibson 2024)\n\n\n\nRoles of the language network. Taken from (Fedorenko, Piantadosi, and Gibson 2024). Subfigure b shows that the language network is not strongly activated for non-linguistic tasks.\n\n\nIn addition, it is notable that CoT restricts models to one discrete reasoning path. However, it might be effective to explore multiple paths. A relevant work that does this is Tree of Thoughts (ToT) (Yao et al. 2023). ToT works by creating a branching structure of multiple potential solutions:\n\nSimilar to CoT it breaks down problems into sequential thought steps\nBut it generates multiple alternative thoughts at each step\nThis can be used to create a tree-like structure of reasoning paths\nThese trees can be explored using either:\n\nBreadth-first search (BFS)\nDepth-first search (DFS)\n\nEach node (state) can be evaluated using a classifier or majority vote",

    "text": "Conclusion\nEndophytic microorganisms are a rich source of novel secondary metabolites, known for their diverse structures and significant biological activities, particularly in antimicrobial and anticancer research. Despite the frequent discovery of new and active natural products (NPs) from these microorganisms, the integration of this data into large-scale databases is often slow, highlighting the importance of efficient information sharing for research and development.\nTo address this EMNPD was developed. This database provides extensive data and interactive visualisation tools to aid in exploring the chemical diversity of these NPs. It is fully searchable and downloadable, designed to support various research perspectives. As interest in endophytic microorganisms continues to grow, EMNPD aims to become an essential resource for advancing drug discovery.\n\n\n\n\nGuo, Jeff, and Philippe Schwaller. 2024. “It Takes Two to Tango: Directly Optimizing for Constrained Synthesizability in Generative Molecular Design.” arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2410.11527.\n\n\nLandrum, Gregory A., Jessica Braun, Paul Katzberger, Marc T.

## Why did I choose this paper?
1. It is a natural product database that aligns with our interests and is now integrated into COCONUT 2.0.
2. The data in this database was mined from literature and using [LitSuggest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/litsuggest/) reviews and low-scoring articles were discarded (threshold <0.6), which also involved fine-tuning the model for optimal performance.
3. This is one of the newest databases that provides extensive information about molecules, including their source organisms, a key feature highly relevant to COCONUT.

## [EMNPD (Endophytic Microorganism Natural Products Database)](http://emnpd.idrblab.cn/ )
- Endophytic microorganisms, residing within plant tissues, play a vital role in biotic and abiotic stress responses by producing diverse natural products (NPs). Approximately 49.5% of FDA-approved drugs are derived from NPs or their derivatives, making endophytes a promising source for novel bioactive compounds. Despite this, existing databases lack a comprehensive focus on endophytes. The newly developed EMNPD database addresses this gap, providing open access to curated data on endophytic microorganism natural products and their bioactivities.

## Conclusion  
Endophytic microorganisms are a rich source of novel secondary metabolites, known for their diverse structures and significant biological activities, particularly in antimicrobial and anticancer research. Despite the frequent discovery of new and active natural products (NPs) from these microorganisms, the integration of this data into large-scale databases is often slow, highlighting the importance of efficient information sharing for research and development. 

To address this EMNPD was developed. This database provides extensive data and interactive visualisation tools to aid in exploring the chemical diversity of these NPs. It is fully searchable and downloadable, designed to support various research perspectives. As interest in endophytic microorganisms continues to grow, EMNPD aims to become an essential resource for advancing drug discovery.
